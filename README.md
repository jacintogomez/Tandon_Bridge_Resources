# Tandon Bridge Resources

`BSTTemplate.cpp`: Template file for a Binary Search Tree with add/delete and print functions.

`LLTemplate.cpp`: Template file for a Linked List with add/remove and print functions.

`LLnoTemplate.cpp`: Same as previous Linked List but without templating the classes.

`SmartPointers.cpp`: Unique, shared, and weak smart pointer examples.

`marriage.cpp `: Demonstration of objects with pointers to each other.

`overloading.cpp`: Demonstration of operator overloading *==, +=, -, <<, >>, [], ++(pre/post).*

`LLandBSTtraversal.cpp`: Comparison between contents of a BST and LL with a recursive function that goes through both simultaneously.

`polymorphism.cpp`: Dynamic binding of function in an Animal class and child classes.

`BaseDerived.cpp`: Shows another type of polymorphism called slicing where a derived class loses its functions when declared as a base object.

`BaseDerivedPointers.cpp`: Shows how slicing does NOT happen when we replicate the situation above with pointers to objects instead of just objects.

`encapsulation.cpp`: Example of a bank account with credit card and debit card classes accessing its protected members.

`HugeInt.cpp`: Shows file reading and writing by taking in a huge int (much larger than C++ can handle) and storing it in a Linked List for addition with another.

`TypeDef.cpp`: Using typedef in replacement of long declarations (instead of vector<vector<vector<int>>>).

`TypeDefFunctions.cpp`: Using typedef to insert functions into a vector and iterate through them like elements.
