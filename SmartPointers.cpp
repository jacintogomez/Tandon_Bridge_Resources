// Created by Jacinto Gomez on 3/4/24.

//4 types of smart pointers:
//1. auto - deprecated so don't use this anymore, was replaced by unique
//2. unique - only allows 1 pointer to a resource; if another pointer tries to point to it
//3. shared - allow multiple pointers to a resource; use_count keeps track of how many pointers are shared in it
//4. weak - observe resource without affecting ownership; cannot directly access the weak pointer
